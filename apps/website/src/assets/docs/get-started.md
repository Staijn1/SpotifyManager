# 🛡️ Permissions <a name="permissions"></a>
When logging in with Spotify, you'll be asked to give Spotify Manager some permissions. Don't worry, we're not asking for your firstborn, just some access to your Spotify account. These permissions are needed for Spotify Manager to work its magic. 🎩✨

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| View your Spotify account data | This includes your email, display name, Spotify followers, and your public playlists. We need this to send you email notifications and show you your own Spotify account on the website. |
| View your activity | This includes your top artists and content, playlists you follow, and your collaborative playlists. We need this to show you your top artists and tracks on the website, similar to Spotify Wrapped. It also lets you see the playlists you might want to create a remix for. |
| Take actions in Spotify on your behalf | This includes creating, editing, and following (private) playlists. When creating a remix, Spotify Manager will create a new playlist in your Spotify account. We also need this to edit the playlist to add new tracks to it when syncing the remix. |
