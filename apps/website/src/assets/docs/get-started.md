# Permissions
When logging in with Spotify you will be asked to give Spotify Manager permission to access different parts of your Spotify account.  
These permissions are required for Spotify Manager to work correctly.
- View your Spotify account data: Email, display name, spotify followers and your public playlists
  - This permission is required to be able to send you email notifications and show you your own Spotify account in the website.
- View your activity: Your top artists and content, playlists you follow and your collaborative playlists
  - This permission is required to be able to show you your top artists and tracks in the website, similar to Spotify Wrapped.
  - The permission to access the playlists you follow is required to show you the playlists you might want to create a remix for (see Remixing documentation)
