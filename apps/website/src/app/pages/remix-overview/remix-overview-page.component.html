  <p class="mb-3">Sync remixed playlists</p>
  <p>
    On this page, you can select one of your remixed playlist, to then synchronize it with the original page.
    For each song that has changed, you will be able to choose if you would like to adhere to that action or not.
    E.g. for a song that has been removed in the original playlist, you can choose to remove it from your playlist as well, or to keep it.
